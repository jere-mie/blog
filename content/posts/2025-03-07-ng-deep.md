Angular developers often hear one piece of advice repeated over and over: *"Never use **`::ng-deep`**."* While this directive is well-intentioned, it can oversimplify the reality of styling complex Angular applications. `::ng-deep` has its place, and when used appropriately, it can solve problems that are otherwise difficult or impossible to address.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore the benefits of `::ng-deep`, debunk some common misconceptions, and discuss how to use it safely.

## Why `::ng-deep` Exists

Angularâ€™s default `ViewEncapsulation` mechanism is designed to encapsulate component styles, preventing them from unintentionally leaking into other parts of the application. This is a great feature, but it comes with some challenges:

- **Styling third-party components**: Some third-party libraries do not expose enough styling hooks.
- **Global theming**: When you need to enforce a consistent theme across all components, encapsulation can be a hindrance.
- **Overriding deeply nested styles**: Some complex UI components render deeply nested elements, which may not be accessible through traditional Angular styling mechanisms.

`::ng-deep` allows styles to break out of Angularâ€™s encapsulation, letting developers target child elements even when encapsulation would normally prevent it.

## Common Arguments Against `::ng-deep` (and Counterarguments)

### **1. It Breaks Encapsulation**

**Argument:** One of Angularâ€™s key advantages is its component encapsulation, and `::ng-deep` circumvents that.

**Counterargument:** While encapsulation is great, there are legitimate cases where you need global control. If used responsibly, `::ng-deep` does not inherently lead to messy styles.

### **2. It Will Be Deprecated**

**Argument:** The Angular team has marked `::ng-deep` as deprecated, so relying on it is risky.

**Counterargument:** While the CSS combinator `::ng-deep` might eventually be removed, the functionality is still needed. Future Angular versions will likely introduce alternative approaches, such as `:host` selectors or custom themes. Until then, `::ng-deep` remains a valid tool when other options are insufficient.

### **3. It Leads to Unmanageable CSS**

**Argument:** Overusing `::ng-deep` can lead to style conflicts and make CSS harder to debug.

**Counterargument:** Any tool can be misused. Following best practicesâ€”such as scoping `::ng-deep` rules to specific components or modulesâ€”keeps styles organized and maintainable.

### **4. It Affects Performance**

**Argument:** Since `::ng-deep` styles apply globally, it can slow down rendering.

**Counterargument:** While excessive global styles can impact performance, isolated and well-scoped `::ng-deep` styles *generally* do not pose significant issues.

## When to Use `::ng-deep`

Despite its drawbacks, there are scenarios where `::ng-deep` is justified:

1. **Styling Third-Party Components:** Some component libraries do not expose CSS variables or class hooks, making `::ng-deep` the only way to customize them.
2. **Theming a Large Application:** If you need a consistent look and feel across deeply nested components, `::ng-deep` can help enforce global styles.
3. **Modifying Styles Deep in the DOM Tree:** If an element is deeply nested inside a child component, and you have no other way to target it, `::ng-deep` is a practical solution.

## How to Use `::ng-deep` Safely

To minimize the risks associated with `::ng-deep`, follow these best practices:

### **1. Scope Styles to a Component**

Instead of applying global styles, scope `::ng-deep` to specific components. Using the `:host` selector alongside `::ng-deep` helps to scope the styles to the specific component, and not leak into the rest of the application:

```scss
:host ::ng-deep .custom-button {
  background-color: red;
}
```

This ensures that styles only affect elements within the component.

### **2. Use It Sparingly**

Avoid using `::ng-deep` unless necessary. If a component exposes proper styling hooks, use those instead.

### **3. Prefer CSS Variables and Component Inputs**

If a third-party library allows customization via CSS variables or inputs, use those instead of `::ng-deep`.

```scss
/* Instead of ::ng-deep, prefer this if supported */
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
}
```

### **4. Document Why You Used It**

Adding comments explaining why `::ng-deep` was necessary can help future developers maintain the codebase.

```scss
/* Necessary because the third-party library does not provide CSS class hooks */
:host ::ng-deep .third-party-element {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

## Conclusion

While `::ng-deep` is often discouraged, it remains a valuable tool in certain scenarios. The key is to use it **wisely and sparingly**. When no other solutions exist, `::ng-deep` provides a way to control styles in complex Angular applications without compromising maintainability.

Instead of fearing `::ng-deep`, learn to wield it responsiblyâ€”and always consider alternative solutions first. When used properly, it can be a lifesaver for styling challenges in Angular applications.
