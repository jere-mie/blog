This is my quick, reliable pizza dough. It uses a stand mixer for easy kneading and proofs in about an hour.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/3 cups warm water
- 1 packet (or ~2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for bowl)

## Method

1. Bloom the yeast: add a splash of the warm water (about 2–3 tbsp) and the sugar to a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast on top, stir lightly, and wait until foamy (a few minutes).
2. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt.
3. When the yeast is active, add it to the mixer along with a glug of olive oil and the remaining warm water.
4. Knead in the mixer on low–medium for about 6–8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
5. Form the dough into a ball, lightly oil a bowl, place the dough inside, and brush a little oil on the surface of the dough to keep it from drying.
6. Cover with a towel and let rise 45 minutes–1 hour, or until doubled. To speed this, put the bowl in the oven with only the oven light on.
7. Use immediately or portion into smaller balls for individual pizzas. Refrigerate for later use.

## Quick Tips

- Warm water should feel like warm bath water, not hot. If it's too hot, it will kill the yeast.
- Hydration is about 66% with these measurements — the dough should be tacky but not sticky.
- If you don't have a stand mixer, knead by hand for ~10–12 minutes.

## Copycat: Little Caesars Crazy Bread

- Spread the dough out to an even, thin thickness (whatever you prefer for breadsticks), then cut into strips.
- Arrange strips on a baking sheet and bake at 450–475°F (230–245°C) for about 8–12 minutes, until golden.
- While hot, brush generously with homemade garlic butter (melted butter + garlic powder or fresh minced garlic) and sprinkle lots of grated Parmesan.

## Copycat: Domino's Cheesy Bread

- Spread the dough out and add shredded mozzarella to one half of the dough.
- Fold the dough over the cheese and press the edges to seal; add a light layer of mozzarella on top.
- Bake at 425–450°F (220–230°C) for 10–15 minutes, until cheese is melted and the crust is browned.
- After baking, brush with homemade garlic butter and finish with grated Parmesan.
